# Procedural Terrain Generation

🌐 Explore the mesmerizing world of dynamic 3D patterns with this JavaScript project that generates a visually stunning grid of colorful and evolving boxes using Perlin noise. 🎨✨

## Overview

This project, aptly named "Procedural Terrain Generation," harnesses the power of Perlin noise to dynamically create a grid of 3D boxes. Each box boasts unique heights and vibrant colors, resulting in a terrain that is not only visually captivating but also ever-changing.

## Features

- 📦 **Dynamic Box Heights:** Each box's height is influenced by Perlin noise, creating a terrain with varying elevations.
- 🌈 **Colorful Palette:** The colors of the boxes dynamically change based on Perlin noise, providing a rich and diverse visual experience.
- 🔄 **Animated Evolution:** Experience an evolving landscape as the project introduces dynamic changes over time.
- 🎥 **Adjustable Perspective:** The use of `rotateX` and `rotateY` allows you to interactively explore the 3D grid from different angles.
